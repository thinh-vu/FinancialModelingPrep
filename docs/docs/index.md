By bringing the capabilities of the Financial Modeling Prep API to the Python ecosystem, we aim to streamline access to valuable financial data, making it more accessible, user-friendly, and versatile.

## Quick Start Guide
### Obtain Your FMP API Key

Starting with the FinancialModelingPrep Python Wrapper is straightforward, and here's how you can do it with ease:

[Choose Your Plan :credit_card:](https://intelligence.financialmodelingprep.com/pricing-plans?couponCode=thinhvu&utm_source=github&utm_medium=thinhvu_repos&utm_campaign=thinhvu){ .md-button }

1. **Sign Up with Google**: FMP offers a convenient signup/login option with Google. Simply use your Google account to streamline the registration process and get access to your FMP account.
    
2. **Setting Your API Key**: Once logged in, navigate to your [dashboard](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/dashboard?couponCode=thinhvu&utm_source=github&utm_medium=thinhvu_repos&utm_campaign=thinhvu). Here, you can generate your unique API key. To make your experience even more seamless, set your API key as the `TOKEN` variable in your python code. This way, you can start using the package without having to manually input your API key each time. 
To safeguard your API key, it's recommended not to hard-code it directly into your project. Instead, consider following the section below to manage your API key using a YAML file.
    
3. **Free vs. Paid Plans**: As a free user, you can access limited features of the wrapper. However, to unlock the full range of capabilities, consider upgrading to one of FMP's paid plans.
    
4. **Pricing Details**: For more information on the pricing plans and what each plan offers, visit the [FMP Pricing Page](https://intelligence.financialmodelingprep.com/pricing-plans?couponCode=thinhvu&utm_source=github&utm_medium=thinhvu_repos&utm_campaign=thinhvu). Here, you can explore the features available in each plan and choose the one that best suits your needs.
    
5. **API Key Usage**: With your API key set as the `TOKEN` variable, you can seamlessly authenticate your requests when using the FinancialModelingPrep Python Wrapper. Detailed documentation and code examples are available to help you get started.

### Manage API key with YAML
Utilizing a YAML file to securely manage your API key is the recommended and straightforward method. Here's a professional guide to implementing this approach:

1. **Create a YAML Configuration File**: Using a trusted text editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, create a YAML configuration file named `fmp_api_key.yaml`. Store this file in a secure location, avoiding any unintentional inclusion in your Git repository. Refer to the template file included in this project [here](https://github.com/thinh-vu/FinancialModelingPrep/blob/main/docs/secret_template.yml)
    
2. **Configure Your YAML File**: In your chosen text editor, structure the content in a key-value pair manner. Specifically, use the format `TOKEN: your_api_key`, ensuring there are no backticks surrounding the `your_api_key` value.
    
3. **Save Your YAML File**: Save the YAML file once you've entered the necessary configuration.
    
4. **Retrieve the File Path**: Note the path to your YAML file as you'll need it for the following function.
    
5. **Incorporate the API Key Retrieval Code**: In your Python project or Jupyter Notebook, integrate the following code. If you're using the demo notebook, you may find this code already present. However, ensure that you replace `'REPLACE_WITH_THE_PATH_TO_YOUR_YAML_FILE'` with the actual path to your YAML file:

```python
from ur_gadget import yaml_cred
TOKEN = yaml_cred('TOKEN', 'YOUR_YAML_FILE_PATH')
```

By following these steps and incorporating the provided code, you'll securely manage your API key through a YAML file, enhancing the protection and accessibility of your financial data credentials.

### Install the package

To install the FinancialModelingPrep Python Wrapper package with the package name "FinancialModelingPrep_Python," follow these instructions:
